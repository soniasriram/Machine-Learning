Mini Project Notebook: Stock Prices Anomaly Detection
Learning Objectives
At the end of the experiment, you will be able to :

apply PCA based analysis on various stocks data
analyze and create time series data
implement LSTM auto-encoders
detect the anomalies based on the loss
Information
Autoencoder Neural Networks try to learn data representation of its input. Usually, we want to learn an efficient encoding that uses fewer parameters/memory. The encoding should allow for output similar to the original input. In a sense, weâ€™re forcing the model to learn the most important features of the data using as few parameters as possible.

LSTM autoencoder is an encoder that makes use of LSTM encoder-decoder architecture to compress data using an encoder and decode it to retain original structure using a decoder.

Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection refers to the task of finding/identifying rare events/data points. Some applications include - bank fraud detection, tumor detection in medical imaging, and errors in written text.

A lot of supervised and unsupervised approaches for anomaly detection have been proposed. Some of the approaches include - One-class SVMs, Bayesian Networks, Cluster analysis, and Neural Networks.

We will use an LSTM Autoencoder Neural Network to detect/predict anomalies (sudden price changes) in the S&P 500 index.

Dataset
This mini-project consists of two parts and two different stock price datasets:

PART A
Using the S&P 500 stock prices data of different companies, we will perform a PCA based analysis.

PART B
Using the S&P 500 stock price index time series data, we will perform anomaly detection in the stock prices across the years. The dataset chosen is is S&P500 Daily Index a .csv format with one column with a daily timestamp and the second column with the raw, un-adjusted closing prices for each day. This long term, granular time series dataset allows researchers to have a good sized publicly available financial dataset to explore time series trends or use as part of a quantitative finance project.

Problem Statement
Detect the stock price anomalies by implementing an LSTM autoencoder
